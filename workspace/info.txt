This folder contains the workspaces for you to import into Query Console.

To import the exercises, open your browser and go to
http://localhost:8000/qconsole. On the right side of your browser, you should
see a panel that lists your QConsole workspaces. Select "Import Workspace..."
from the Workspace drop down menu, and browse to the *.xml files in this
directory.
